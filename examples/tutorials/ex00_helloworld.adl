#  title "hello world: Basic features example with high pT jets"

# OBJECT SELECTION
# Define a new "goodjets" object collection from the jet collection in the event.
# Take all jets in the event, and select the subset agreeing with given criteria.
object goodjets
  take JET # take and loop over all jets in the event
  select pt(JET) > 30 # require each jet in the event to have pt > 30
  select abs(eta(JET)) < 2.4 # require each jet in the event to have |eta| < 2.4

# EVENT SELECTION
# Define an event selection region called "preselection"
# Select events that pass certain criteria
region preselection
  select ALL # write out the initial number of events
  select size(goodjets) > 3 # require events to have > 3 jets
  select pt(goodjets[0]) > 300 # require the 1st jet pT to be > 300
  select pt(goodjets[1]) > 200 # require the 2nd jet pT to be > 200
  select pt(goodjets[2]) > 100 # require the 3rd jet pT to be > 100
