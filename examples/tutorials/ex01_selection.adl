# ADL/CL example 1: Simple object and event selection
# Object and event selection is a fundamental part of each analysis.
# "object" blocks define objects.
# "region" blocks define event selections.
#
# Selection criteria are applied using comparison, range and logical operators
# listed in Table 12 of arXiv:2101.09031
# and the ternary operator described in A.5.2 of arXiv:2101.09031.

# OBJECT SELECTION
# Predefined main objects in CL are: ELE, MUO, TAU, JET, PHO, METLV (case insensitive)
#    (see Table 7 in arXiv:2101.09031)
# All object collections are by default ordered by decreasing pT
# Objects can be derived from each other or predefined objects can be directly used.
# Each selection in an object block is applied to each object in the input collection.

object goodJets # Target jet collection
  take Jet # Input jet collection
  select pT(Jet) > 50 # applied to each jet in the collection
  select abs(eta(Jet)) < 2.4 # applied to each jet in the collection

# Now select b-tagged jets among the goodJet collection
object goodbJets
  take goodJets # Input can be an object collection defined in the ADL file.
  select BTag(goodJets) == 1

object goodEles
  take Ele
  select pT(Ele) > 20
  select abs(eta(Ele)) < 2.1

object goodMuos
  take Muo
  select pT(Muo) > 20
  select abs(eta(Muo)) < 2.1

# Combine two collections to make a new one:
object leptons : Union(goodEles, goodMuos)

# EVENT SELECTION
# Each region corresponds to a phase space of event selection.
# Regions can be derived from each other.
# Individual objects in a collection can be accessed via their indices.
region baseline
  select ALL # write out the initial number of events
  select size(goodJets) >= 3
  select size(goodbJets) >= 1
  select pT(goodJets[0]) > 200 # require highest momentum jet pT to be > 200.
  select size(leptons) == 1

region singleelectron

  select size(goodEles) == 1
