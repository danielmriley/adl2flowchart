# ADL/CL example 7 : Chi2 optimization
# Goal is to reconstruct fully hadronic ttbar: t -> W b, W -> j j without explicit b-jet tagging.
#
# In this context, optimization refers to finding the best combinations of 6 jets assigned to 
# W bosons and top quarks from which they originate.
#
# A chi2-like equation is constructed from the jet propoerties, and optimized.
# The objects in the chi2 definitions are written with negative indices.
# Regularly used positive indices are constants, while - indices are variables.
# The optimization operations loop over the objects and find the best values for - indices.
#
# There are two optimization operators:
#   ~=  : Closest to
#   ~!  : Furthest from

  select abs(eta(JET)) < 2.5

# ALIAS DEFINITIONS

# Define Ws from goodJets:
# "-" indexes mean that initial indices are not known and 
# will be assigned as a result of optimization.
# Repeated indices in the same W mean that they are interchangable, 
# i.e. the order is not important : jet1 + jet2 = jet2 + jet1
define W1 = goodjet[-1] + goodjet[-1] 
define W2 = goodjet[-3] + goodjet[-3] 
# Define a chi2, which, when minimized, would do the best jet assignment to both Ws:
define Wchi2 = ((m(W1) - 80.4)/2.1)^2 + ((m(W2) - 80.4)/2.1)^2 

# Goal is to find two jets originating from b quarks, but not from W bosons.
# Indices different than those in W definitions are used.
define bcand1 = goodjet[-2] 
define bcand2 = goodjet[-4] 
# Define the top quarks:
define Top1 = W1 + bcand1 # take another jet with the + sign...
define Top2 = W2 + bcand2
# Define a chi2, which, when minimized, would do the best jet assignment to Ws and bs:
define topchi2 = ((m(Top1) - m(Top2))/4.2)^2  
# Define a final chi2 from W and top:
# We would like to keep both W and top chi2 low, hence 
define totchi2 = topchi2 + Wchi2

# EVENT SELECTION AND CHI2 OPTIMIZATION

region besttop
  # select 6 jets which should come from hadronically decaying tops:
  select Size(goodjet) >= 6  
  # find the assignment of jets to tops and Ws, which give the chi2 closest to 0:
  select totchi2 ~= 0  
  # some histograms:
  chi2histos
  # once optimization is done and chi2 calculated, select events with small chi2:
  select totchi2 < 20.0
  # same histograms after cut on chi2
